## Background

The selection of survival models for informing economic evaluations of innovative therapies with limited long-term data traditionally relies on model selection algorithms applied in the full trial data. Models selected based on full trial data might underperform in the target population due to overfitting. K-fold cross validation (CV) is commonly used in machine learning for better estimation of fit in unseen data. We explore whether k-fold CV improves model selection.

# Instructions

This repository includes Code for paper on the use of k-fold cross validation for the selection of survival curves for health technology assessments.

This repository does not contain the data used, but most datasets are available through the survival package. The other datasets are accessible through SEER and other sources linked in the script.
